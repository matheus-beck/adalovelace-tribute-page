            <blockquote>
              <p>"Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see. In Babbage's world his engines were bound by number...
              What Lovelace saw—what Ada Byron saw—was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a 
              machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine 
              could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules."</p>
